      <div class=textBox>  <p>Hello, My name is Upasana Dilip. I currently go to Kennedy Middle School and will be graduating this year. After this summer, I will be going to Monta Vista High School. When I graduate from high school, which seems like eons away, though the time will fly by, I plan to go to a good college. <p></div>
